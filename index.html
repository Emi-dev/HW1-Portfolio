                        Hello! My name is Emi Clar. I was born and raised in Japan. 
                        I have lived in Bethlehem, PA, Boston, MA, and currently live in Winter Springs, FL.
                        I have a 7-year-old daughter, and she means the world to me.
                        I have two Chihuahuas named, Momo and Yuzu. Momo means &quot;peach&quot; and Yuzu means &quot;yuzu citrus&quot; in Japanese.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I love to travel and eat. My favorite places that I've visited are Paris, France and Kyoto, Japan.
                        My next destination (when I can afford time and $$$) is Italy.
                        I took 2 years of Italian language classes (upto intermediate II) using all my electives in college because visiting (or living in) Italy had always been my dream.
                        However, I stopped using Italian and forgot pretty much everything I learned... and still haven't been to the country...
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My favorite types of food are: Japanese, Italian, French, Greek, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, and Mexican.
                        I especially like sushi and pasta.
                        I still haven't found my favorite Italian restaurant in Orlando area, but my favorite sushi restaurant in the area is WA SUSHI in Casselberry.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My dream is to work as a web developer or software engineer.
                        And eventually (hopefully in the near future), I would love to work remotely so that I can visit and spend enough time with my family and friends in Japan while working.
